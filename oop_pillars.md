# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is OOP?
### Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes.

### The benefits of OOP are:

* Being faster and easier to execute
* Providing a clear structure for a program
* Making code easier to modify, debug and maintain 
* Making it easier to reuse code

### The four pillars of OOP are:

* Abstraction (this is used to reduce the amount of code)
* Encapsulation (making parts of your code private)
* Inheritance (let's one object acquire the properties of another)
* Polymorphism (allows to perform an action in multiple ways)
