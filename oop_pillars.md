# Object Oriented Programming (OOP)

## What is OOP?
### Object-oriented programming is based on the concept of objects. In object-oriented programming data structures, or objects are defined, each with its own properties or attributes.

### The benefits of OOP are:

* Being faster and easier to execute
* Providing a clear structure for a program
* Making code easier to modify, debug and maintain 
* Making it easier to reuse code

* Classes are user-defined data types that act as the blueprint for individual objects, attributes and methods
* Objects are instances of a class created with specifically defined data
* Methods are functions that are defined inside a class that describe the behaviors of an object
* Attributes are defined in the class template and represent the state of an object

### The four pillars of OOP are:

* Abstraction - this is used to reduce the amount of code, which is always useful as it saves time
* Encapsulation - this involves making parts of your code private, you may not others to see the entirety of your code
* Inheritance -let's one object acquire the properties of another, this is used in classes
* Polymorphism - allows to perform an action in multiple ways, so they are different ways to arrive to the same outcome
